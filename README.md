My first MERN Stack app.After learning basics of Node js, Express js and MongoDB, I decided to build a simple app to put my knowledge into practice. I created REST API using Expreess js and used React + RTK query for the client side.RTK Query is a powerful data fetching and caching tool and using it helped me a lot in this matter
