I have built my first MERN Stack app after learning the basics of Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. The goal was to put my newly acquired knowledge into practice. I developed a REST API using Express.js and utilized React along with RTK Query for the client-side. RTK Query is a powerful data fetching and caching tool, which proved to be highly beneficial for me in terms of optimizing performance.
